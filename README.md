Let's say we had a user class. It has a login method that sets logged_in to true. Then our student subclass is no able to log in as well. But, when our student logsin they need to do more then just login, they need to also mark themselves as attending class. We already have our login method. Other parts of the program are using that login method. What we want is to make the login method to the standard login stuff PLUS a bit more. It should set another boolean called in_class to true. How do we do this? with super. super calls the parent and then you can do more. Best part (and show them this) if we add a feature to the parents login, the subclass gets it. So maybe when you login we add it to a class variable called LOGGEDINUSERS.
